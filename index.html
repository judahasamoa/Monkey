    <h1>Monkey</h1>
<p>1. Monkeys are intelligent, social animals. They are members of the primate group of mammals, which includes apes and humans. There are approximately 200 different species of monkeys. Scientists classify them as old world monkeys or new world monkeys. Baboons, drills, mandrills, macaques, guenons, langurs, and colobus monkeys are examples of old world monkeys.

    <p>2. Monkeys vary greatly in size. The pygmy marmoset is only about 6 inches (14 centimeters) long, not including the tail. The largest baboons may grow to 45 inches (115 centimeters) in length. <br>

        On the whole, Old World monkeys are larger than New World monkeys. Old World monkeys also have narrower noses than New World monkeys do. New World monkeys usually have long tails. Some kinds even use their tails to hold onto branches. By contrast, some Old World monkeys have only short stubs for tails.

        <p>3. Monkeys use all four limbsâ€”two arms and two legsâ€”to walk and run. Their hands and feet are good for grasping tree branches. Monkeys have a coat of hair on most of their bodies. Many types have bare areas of skin on the face and buttocks. Male mandrills and some other types have brightly colored skin in these bare areas. Most monkeys have fairly flat faces. However, baboons and mandrills have doglike faces, with snouts that stick out.
